                <div class="card-text">
                    <p> Hello World! I'm Jim Collado, a focused and quick-learning student with two years of experience in computer science and programming,
                        I have learned several programming languages such as Java, Python, and C to create mobile web services
                        and applications, and IoT devices, as well as complete other class projects during my time at Baldwin Wallace.
                        I have strong skills in problem-solving, and teamwork, and am looking for a position that will allow me to contribute
                        to meaningful projects while expanding my technical skills and knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row mt-3">
                        <p> During my enrollment at Baldwin Wallace, I embarked on my journey into computer science and programming. Over
                            the course of two years, I delved into various courses offered by the university which explored the different components
                            and theories of programming and computer science, while also gaining proficiency in a wide range of programming languages.

                            Throughout my time at BW, I undertook several small projects for my classes, which provided me with invaluable practice and helped me hone my skills.
                            These projects ranged from basic data manipulation to utilizing algorithms I had learned in class. As I progressed to my senior year courses, the projects
                            became increasingly challenging, requiring me to develop applications that could tackle much larger tasks such as mobile apps that connected to web services 
                            and creating IoT devices.

                                                to develop an intelligent agent that was capable of playing a game of Connect 4 almost perfectly against either
                                                another player or itself. Utilizing the minimax and minimax alpha-beta pruning, our group had used Python to create
                                                both the game and the agent. By the end of the project, we had looked into serveral methods of improving the speed of the agent
                                                and the quality of it's moves and compared it performance when utilizing different depth levels in our Min-Max Algorithm.

                                Our app communicates with a web service and was able to get/post data to a database. The app is built from the ground up using several concepts we went over in class such as how to use PHP to communicate to a web service and programming in Java.
                                This project has helped improve my understanding of PHP, Java, and the XML format for some files used in our project.

                                a buzzer, and a servo. The goal was to create a device that would retrieve the temperature of the room and adujust the servo to show the current temperature and provide an audio cue each time a new temperature is detected.
                                It served as a great introduction to working with a Raspberry Pi and making connections to sensors and small devices. This project would prove useful in future projects where I connect a similar device to a web dashboard.

                            <p class="card-text">One of my personal favorites, this final project was for my IoT (Internet of Things) course, in which I had worked with a partner to create a mailbox that was capable of 
                                detecting when a package has been left inside and reports the time of delivery to a database which is shown on web dashboard. The box also features two servos. One servo acts as a lock mechanism and the other controls the flag. Both of which are triggered after motion is detected
                                and the box is closed. In total, this project uses an ESP8266 to control the servos and PIR sensor, a Raspberry Pi to host the webpage and contain the database, two servos, and a PIR sensor. In this project, 
                                my partner and had to utilize our knowledge in SQL, PHP, HTML, Python, and C to create our dashboard and setup our devices.

                            <p class="card-text">Now while it may seem redundant to feature my own online portfolio as one of my featured projects, I think it deserves to be here because it was one of the first times that I worked with HTML and CSS outside of
                                my classes. I think it is good way to showcase the knowledge I've gained from my CS courses about how to use HTML. While very basic and could still use some work, learning how to use HTML and libraries like bootstrap really helped. I plan to continue updating this portfolio and making improvements in my free time
                                as I learn more.
